We're very excited - not just because of the inordinate amount of caffeine based products consumed - 
but also because our team are putting together 
the final missing parts to the biggest Google related event in Jordan - [GDG DevFest 2014](http://mhmdaljobairi.github.io/gdgyarmouk). 

This year event will take place in cultural capital of Jordan - Ammanis the capital and most populous city of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. It is the country's political, cultural and commercial centre and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The Greater Amman area has a population of 2,842,629 as of 2010.[2] The recent economic growth experienced in Amman is unmatched by any other Arab city except those located in the Persian Gulf area. Amman is also the administrative seat of the homonymous governorate. Amman is also ranked a Betaâˆ’ global city on the World city index, the same category as Abu Dhabi, Kuwait City and Manama.

So should you also be excited? Well yes... and here's why!

* **Attendance**: we're expecting over 120 attendees
* **Topic**: more than 10 hours of pure Google technologies 
* **Date**: 29 Sept ,2014
